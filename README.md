# Intern-Eligibility-Classification-Data-Science-Project-

In this study, I analysed the candidates scores and their skills based on which their eligibility was depended for the Internship. I identified CGPA, Written communication skills and Verbal communication skills are the most important features which affect the selection of the candidate. I built classification models to predict which candidates are eligible/ineligible. These models can be very useful in helping other companies in number of ways. For example, it could help identify the candidates who are more deserving and eligible for the posts available in the company.
